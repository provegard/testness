## Intro

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/provegard/testness.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/provegard/testness)

TestNess is a tool for measuring quality of unit test cases in .NET. It is 
intended to work with a number of unit test frameworks, such as Visual
Studio's own, NUnit, MbUnit and XUnit.

Note that TestNess was conceived without knowledge about Typemock's Test Lint.
Unlike Test Lint, TestNess is open source. The unit test rules overlap, of
course, since unit test rules seem to be quite universal.
